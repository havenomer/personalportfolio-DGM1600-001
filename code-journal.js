/* Variables - containers that store values */

var name // a declared variable, but not initialized and it's in the global scope (BAD)

let foo // a declared variable that can be changed

const bar // a declared variable that cannot be changed = short for "constant"

const ANSWER = 42 // const is declared and initialized with the value 42

//Strings

let string1 = "Hello World" // Read the '=' as 'is assigned the value of...'

let string2 = 'Hello Utah'

let string3 = new String('Hello World!')

//Number

let myNum = 548143

let myNum2 = 45.69

'1' == 1 // This statement is trur because of type coercion and loose quality checking

'1' === 1 // False because this is strict equality checking

//Boolean

let myBool = true

// Array

let myArray = [] // this is an empty array

let myArray2 = [42, 'Bob', myBool, ANSWER, true]
